# This is a simple QT timeline visualizer

The initial aim of the project is to provide a way to visualize the profiler data collected by project at
[arsdever/prof](https://github.com/arsdever/prof).

## New version in development (Model/View approach)

I'm trying to change the architecture of the project to use Model/View approach.
Please checkout `model-view-approach` branch for the latest changes.

Such an example you can see under `sample` project. Here is the outcome whe the program is run.
